这个音乐播放器有望是一个独立app，我的创意在于这个播放器可以随时使用，每个人都可以把自己喜欢的音乐传到上面，可以当作是一个“里面全是自己喜欢听的音乐的播放器”，或许会多此一举？但是我在许多音乐平台发现一个问题就是“我喜欢”模块中的音乐收藏已经很多了，但是随着品味的改变有些旧音乐没有来得及清理，这个播放器可以随时删改，做到只有最近喜欢听的音乐和一直喜欢听的音乐在此播放器中，这就是我做这个项目的初衷。（This music player has the potential to be a standalone app. My idea is that this player can be used anytime, and everyone can upload their favorite music to it. It can be seen as a "music player full of music you love to listen to." Perhaps it may seem redundant? However, I have noticed a problem on many music platforms in the "Favorites" section where there are already many music collections, but with changing tastes, some old music may not have been cleared out in time. This player allows for editing at any time, ensuring that only the most recently liked music and the always liked music are played in this player. This is the original intention behind my project.）
